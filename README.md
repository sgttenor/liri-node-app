This application uses node.JS to log out information from Spotify, OMDB and Bands in town for those wanting information for specific searches.


when using the application type in 'node liri.js and either 'concert-this', 'movie-this', 'spotify-this-song', and 'do-this' to access information.

first we will use spotify-this-song and query a song of choice. (I enjoy Billy Joel so I will use his song 'Piano Man')
