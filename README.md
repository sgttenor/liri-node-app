This application uses node.JS to log out information from Spotify, OMDB and Bands in town for those wanting information for specific searches.


When using the application type in 'node liri.js and either 'concert-this', 'movie-this', 'spotify-this-song', and 'do-this' to access information.

First we will use spotify-this-song and query a song of choice. (I enjoy Billy Joel so I will use his most popular song, 'Piano Man').

Results will give you the name of the song, Artist, Song title, Album from where it's from, and link to a preview of the song.

Next we will use 'movie-this' to provide movie information... Who hasn't seen spaceballs?

Results will give you - Title, Year, IMDB rating,  Rotten Tomatoes Rating, Country from where it was made, language, Plot, and Actors who were in the movie.

Now we will use concert-this to search for a band/artist and where they will be playing.

I want to see imagine dragons at some point. The results will show venue name, where it is, and the date of the concert.

Finally 'do-this' will print out what's in the random.txt file. It will print out one of my all-time favorite movies.

Don't laugh or judge me. Haha love the score plus Jane Seymour just radiates the screen.
